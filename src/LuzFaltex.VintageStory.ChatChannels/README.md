- [ ] Integration with Titles.
- [ ] A full VTML parsing library.
- [ ] Moderation tools, such as deleting messages or highlighing announcements.
- [ ] View options! You can have a tab for each chat channel or you can have a unified view with commands to change which channel you're writing to.
- [ ] In-game configuration editing.
- [ ] PlaceholderAPI support.
- [ ] Custom channel formatting using PlaceholderAPI and VTML.
- [ ] Private messages.
- [ ] SQL Logging of messages, if desired.
